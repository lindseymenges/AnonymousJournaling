Anonymous Journaling
====================

Anonymous Journaling is a webapp that allows you to write journal entries that can be read by others. A user receives a randomly assigned screen name so that the contents of their entries cannot be traced back to them. It's social journaling, but identities are kept secret!

Users can create accounts, write journal entries, read the entries of other users, and follow their journals if you want to keep up with them.

Anonymous Journaling is currently under construction.
